# Contributing to Cloud Native Patterns
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the patterns
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new patterns
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the patterns. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added pattern, double check for typos
3. If you've changed pattern, explain change in the PR comment
5. Make sure your patterns are following the structure of the pattern
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the `Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License`
In short, when you submit pattern changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [CC 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/cloud-native-patterns/issues/new/choose).

## Write issue reports with detail, background and explanation

**Great Issue Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- What you expected should be included in the pattern
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be needed)

## Use a Consistent Pattern Layout
The pattern should use the following layout:
```markdown

---
title: <name of the pattern>
description: <description>
layout: pattern
---

![<name of the pattern>]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/generic.png) //link to image if relevant

<situation description>
