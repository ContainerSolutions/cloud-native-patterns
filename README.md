# What are Cloud Native Patterns?
When it comes to Cloud Native, most of us are junior. The technology is so new, and our understanding of the architecture is constantly evolving. Sharing our rapidly growing knowledge is essential. Creating Cloud Native-specific patterns is a way to name the things we are learning as developers, engineers, and technology managers so we can talk to each other more effectively. As we learn and continue, the patterns will evolve and improve alongside our understanding.

# Contributing
This is far from an exhaustive list of patterns, and we welcome contributions from all industry practicioners who would like
to share their expertise with the community in the form of patterns.
Reach out to us [here](https://cnpatterns.org/contact-us) for help with writing your own patterns.
