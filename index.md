# What are Cloud Native Patterns?

When it comes to Cloud Native, most of us are junior. The technology is so new, and our understanding of the architecture is constantly evolving. Sharing our rapidly growing knowledge is essential. Creating Cloud Native-specific patterns is a way to name the things we are learning as developers, engineers, and technology managers so we can talk to each other more effectively. As we learn and continue, the patterns will evolve and improve alongside our understanding.

Patterns are not a hack. They are not a quick and easy way to solve difficult problems without careful thought. Instead, they are a language for sharing context-specific working solutions. And here is the place to find and explore Cloud Native patterns--and, soon, share some of your own. **This site is intended to be the home of a Cloud Native patterns community, the place to explore existing patterns and collaborate on creating new ones.** We openly welcome questions, conversation, and contributions!
