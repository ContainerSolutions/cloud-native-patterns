# Cloud Native Transformation: Practical Patterns for Innovation

This website grew from this newly published book from O’Reilly: 78 Cloud Native patterns covering everything from Microservices Architecture to CN DevOps to becoming a responsive Learning Organization that can innovate to adjust to any kind of future. Books are so final, though, and so we sponsored this website to provide a living, evolving patterns repository that grows along with our knowledge and understanding.

Here you will find not just the newest patterns as they continue to emerge, but also an online community for discussing, creating and improving them. We are inviting people from across the industry, thought leaders and influencers but most importantly everyday engineers and managers—those out there working elbows-deep in Cloud Native code and architecture—to contribute and participate.

Let’s write more patterns - together!

You can preview the book by downloading a free 75-page excerpt [here](https://info.container-solutions.com/free-oreilly-cloud-native-transformation-excerpt)
