The company has established a Business Case for going cloud native, achieved Executive Commitment, and is ready to move forward with a transformation initiative.

## In This Context

The company needs to define a clear and achievable vision that can be translated into specific executable steps.

- Without an overall consistent vision, different teams will make independent and,frequently, conflicting architectural decisions.
- The combination of limited experience and lack of extra time and flexibility for research leads to pursuing cloud native implementation using “well-known ways.”
- In many companies, enterprise architects are responsible for creating a detailed architecture. Many enterprise architects lack sufficient theoretical or practical experience in the cloud native approach.
- Agile methodologies, widely adopted in the contemporary business world, create pressure to produce results early and onboard teams to new systems very quickly.

## Therefore

Define and visualize the organizational structure and architecture of the whole system upfront.

- This can be either requested from external sources or uncovered by a series of small research and prototyping projects ranging from a few hours to a few days each.
- Keep the vision high-level to allow freedom of choice during implementation(not dictating specific tools or approaches) yet also specific enough to provide clear goals and desired outcomes.
- Revisit the vision regularly to evaluate status and adjust the plan if necessary.
- Executive Commitment paired with leadership by the Transformation Champion are essential for successful vision creation—this indicates the path for the teams to follow.

## Consequently

All teams have a clear guiding principle for the implementation phase.
