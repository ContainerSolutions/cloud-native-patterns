A company is commencing a cloud native transformation, has completely and successfullymigrated its platform, or is at any point along the way. Traditionally, companiescould set strategy, translate to objectives, and then move comfortably into longtermexecution without ever looking back to re-evaluate. Today’s environment isuncertain and constantly changing. Cloud native evolved in response to this reality asa nimble, scalable, and fast framework for handling constant variability.

## In This Context

Not responding quickly enough to market changes or new information may lead the company to continue building products according to an old strategy that is no longer fully relevant. The original strategy could be realized in its totality, but in the meanwhile competitors could come up with better products, technology could change, and much better opportunities could be missed.Ultimately, the company may end up with exactly what was planned in the beginning of the project—only to find that this is not what they actually need when they finally go to market.

- New technologies are constantly introduced, bringing unexpected new competitors to every sector.
- Low-certainty projects carry extremely high risk. Any decision made early in the project is highly likely to be uncovered as a wrong decision later.

## Therefore

Continually re-evaluate circumstances as the initiative moves forward.Check if the relevant products are still in demand and if the chosen technologies,organizational structure, and development processes are still the best for the most successful delivery. Always monitor the competition to adjust delivery planning and releasing optimal functionality to maximize market impact.\`

- If adjustment is required, use the Gradually Raising the Stakes pattern to reduce risk and make better decisions.
- Dynamic Strategy is essential for doing cloud native right, from inception to completion. This pattern is so essential that it is built into our transformation design from the beginning.
- Use Reflective Breaks for the executive team to review and reassess strategy.

## Consequently

The executive leaders are aware when the environment changes and adjust strategic goals to keep the company heading in the right direction.
