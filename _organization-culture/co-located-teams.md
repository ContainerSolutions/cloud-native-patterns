An organization that is moving to cloud native has multiple offices and office buildings.Teams that are targeted to move to cloud native have individual members located in multiple physical locations.

## In This Context

When team members are located in different places, they tend to communicate less and focus on their jobs rather than personal relationships. This hobbles team problem-solving, because individuals will attempt to solve problems separately and then contribute that solution back to the teamâ€”rather than solving them collaboratively with teammates.

- Creative teams especially are more effective when personal relationships are on a higher level.
- Complex communication is better in person.
- Cloud native is a paradigm shift that requires new ways of working and creative problem-solving.

## Therefore

All members of a given dev team will work in the same physical location and meetdaily.All meetings and collaboration will be first done using whiteboards, pen and paper,etc. Teams will be chosen based on location. If the team is in the same office, then move the members to sit at adjacent desks.

- Periodic team-building events to strengthen personal relationships.
- Encourage the team to talk to one another in person.
- Consider pair programming.

## Consequently

High level of trust and proximity naturally increases collaboration.
